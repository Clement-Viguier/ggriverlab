## Labels for rivers in the ggplot2 framework

ggriverlab aims to introduce labels that follow lines to creat nice maps with ggplot2.
Maybe I should learn how to use GIS dedicated softwares, but it is more to implement this function in R.

## First step: positioning labels

Before having functional labels and defining nice default parameters that give nice maps, I need to implement and test the basic postiioning of labels along a path.



### TO DO LIST

- make it work with point: place points along the path in place of letters.
- include in geom
- make it work with entire labels
- make it work with letters


### TO DO if the rest is done and clean

- make river specific geom (size~order)
- make interactive tool to test the parameters
- find good default parameters
- scale against text size or plot size ?
